* The "zglDraw_" prefix.
- It's bad and inconsistent with my three-letter prefix style. Change all
  "zglDraw_FUNCTION to "zgl_DrawFUNCTION" or some such.

* Does "mPixel" need to exist?
- Do we really need explicit separation of the integer and fixed-point screen
  units? They are both just int32_t. Why not just have the fundamental unit of
  zgl_Pixel and keep track of precision in another way (say, by passing
  precision to functions as an argument)?
